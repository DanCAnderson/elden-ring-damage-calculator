# Elden Ring Damage Calculator

## Usage

Enter your attributes at the top, then either search for the best weapon for your stats, or look up a specific weapon and see how it will perform.

You can customrize the search results by clicking "Search Options". If you click on a weapon in the results table it will show you the graphs for that weapon.

The graphs show how different weapon stats vary with upgrade level:
- Total AR
- Attribute scaling
- Passive effects

## Credits

All data and calculations are from the spreadsheet by u/TarnishedSpreadsheet [here's the reddit post with all the updates and spinoff projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tbco46/elden_ring_weapon_calculator/)

## ToDo
- Calculate sorcery scaling for staffs etc (possibly a separate table & filter?)
- Show weapon scaling with attributes
    - just scale against one attribute for now (starting at minimum)
    - Give dropdown for attribute select?
- Do proper calculations when you're below the stat requirements
